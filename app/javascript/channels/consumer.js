// Action Cable provides the framework to deal with WebSockets in Rails.
// You can generate new channels where WebSocket features live using the `bin/rails generate channel` command.
// The client of a WebSocket connection is called the consumer.
// In Action Cable, the consumer is created by the client-side JavaScript framework.
